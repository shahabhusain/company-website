            Coaches hold the reins on session payments by customizing charges
            based on session lengths, granting them the flexibility to set
            prices as they deem fit for 30, 45, or 60-minute sessions. Time
            slots are entirely at the coach's discretion, ensuring flexibility
            and convenience for both parties involved.
